# ZK-Gesture
Verifying hand signals on-chain with ML and ZK

# Concept
ZK Gesture is an innovative Hackathon project that integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs to create a novel authentication system on the blockchain. The core idea is to use hand gestures, specifically patterns like a Vulcan hand salute, as a unique authenticator for blockchain transactions.

# Demo
https://zk-gesture-pi.vercel.app/

Steps
- Enable camera permission (All images remain on your device)
- While making a hand pose on the camera click on "Capture Reference Image". This forms the reference image that will be used to evaluate further hand poses that are made.
- Submit a second hand pose by clicking on "Capture User Image". This will be used to compare with the reference hand signal.
- Click on "Compare" to be shown the result. All actions happen on the browser.


# Technology Stack:
Machine Learning: The project leverages TensorFlow, a popular ML framework, running in the browser to detect and analyze hand patterns. https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/hand-pose-detection

Blockchain: This solution requires ZK and can be deployed on blockchains that support ZK. ZK-Gesture is deployed on Aleo blockchain.

Zero Knowledge Proofs: Utilizes ZK proofs to confirm computations that happened off-chain without revealing specific data about the transactions.

# Aleo Blockchain:
Contract deployed on Aleo https://explorer.aleo.org/transaction/at1ty7ml5jvtpnw546eq0u25eakt6wyed30uy50u574wenm56mfespq7x05lq?tab=overview

It uses two different on-chain methods
- set_reference_points: This method sets the hand pose that has to be followed on subsequent verify actions.
- verify: This method verifies that the input provided by the user matches the reference points that are set.

TODO: The example does not implement the on-chain check for set_reference_points or verify at the moment. This can however be done with the https://aleo.tools/develop and loading the contract aleo_contract.aleo, load a private key and should be able to perform actions with the following parameters as an example

- set_reference_points

# How It Works:
Initial Scan: A user performs a hand gesture, which is captured and set as their reference pattern.

Subsequent Transactions: For future transactions, the user repeats the gesture. The system then compares this new pattern to the initial reference.

Normalization and Verification: To simplify the ZK component, the captured points are normalized and compared with the reference points to verify a match.

Advancements in ZK: The project capitalizes on recent advancements in ZK proofs, allowing the verification with ZK computation of off-chain models and making the system more efficient and robust.

# Potential Use Cases:
With more improvements to ZK, we could potentially run the whole ML model on-chain. We could also use more complex ML models than on this example.

Authentication: Similar to Face ID or Touch ID, ZK Gesture could offer a new form of biometric authentication for secure access and transactions.

Blockchain Applications: The combination of ML and ZK proofs equips the blockchain with "eyes and ears," enabling it to process and authenticate unique physical patterns.

Future Implications: This project paves the way for more complex and secure authentication methods in blockchain technology, expanding possibilities for user verification and transaction security.
